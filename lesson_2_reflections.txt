What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git creates a repository consisting of the current folder. Git creates the meta data folder
	(.git). The files in the folder are not included into the repository. The reason for this is
	that you maybe don't want to include every file. The files are added to the repository with
	the first commit which you have to do yourself (manually). With the creating of the repository
	there is no first commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think
it offers?

	The staging area is an intermediate stage between the working directory and the repository. You
	can not access it with the cd command. It is only for gathering the files to be commited. The files
	in there are still not "saved" in the repository and therefor not tracked.
	The benefit of the staging area is that you can easily gather the files for a commit in one place and
	have an overview about what will be commited.
